Place the Apex Metadata API wrapper classes here.

Recommended source: https://github.com/certinia/apex-mdapi (MetadataService.cls and related files).

Notes
- Ensure class API versions align with the org (61.0+ recommended).
- Include only required classes to minimize package surface area.
- After adding, run Apex tests to validate object/field creation flows.
